I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.\r\n\r\nI should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.\r\nWhen, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nJohn Due', 1492371296, 0);

How much will it cost to travel to Iran?', 'Prices for our travel packages from Europe typically start at 3500 EUR per person for 2 weeks including all accommodation,  flights (domestic and international), transfers, tours, some meals and Visa issuance for entry into Iran. \r\n\r\nPricing is dependent on the “class” of accommodation (3-5 Star) and the “number” of travelers in your group, the more people to share costs the less it will cost per person. Pricing is also significantly affected by the “Dates” you chose to travel ranging from Basic Season (cheap) to Peak (expensive).', 1, 1),

Are self-drive packages available for Iran?', 'Yes, self-drive travel packages that include rental vehicles are available and can be tailored to suit your needs.\r\n\r\nAll drivers, including visitors from other countries, must carry their license or permit at all times when driving. You must have either a current driver’s license from your home country or an International Driving Permit (IDP). You will only be able to drive the same types of vehicles you are licensed to drive in your home country. Make sure your driver’s license is current and in English. If your license is not in English, you must bring an English translation with you or obtain an IDP. Contact your local automobile club for further details about obtaining a translation or an IDP.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that in Iran we drive on the right-hand side of the road. Drivers give way (or yield) to all traffic crossing or approaching from the right. Signposting follows standard international symbols and all distances are in kilometers (km). Both drivers & passengers must wear a safety belt in both the front and back seats.\r\n\r\nHere are some general tips and hints to help you drive safely:\r\n\r\nAlways drive on the left-hand side of the road and give way to your right\r\nAll road distances are measured in kilometres\r\nWhen turning left, give way (yield) to traffic crossing or approaching from your right\r\nWhen the traffic light is red, you must stop. There is no left turn rule as in North America.\r\nThe amber traffic light means stop unless you are so close to the intersection you can’t stop safely.\r\nRandom police stops for breath testing can occur at anytime \r\nCameras are also common place along highways and stoplight intersections.  Fines are sent by post for speed or stopping violations.', 4, 1),
(3, '2. How long does it take to get to Iran?', 'An average non-stop flight from the Europe to Iran takes 4 to 7 hours approximately.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the way back, the flight time is less due to the prevailing Easterly winds. Flight times may vary depending on routing.', 2, 1),

This allowance is applicable to all your Qantas flights in your booking (including both International and Domestic sectors). However some flights in Australia (e.g. to Heron Island) are restricted to 1 piece per person plus a carry-on. Please check with the Airlines for baggage restrictions associated with your flights before you depart the USA. Penalties may be issued by the Airlines as a result of excess baggage. Excess baggage penalties are your responsibility. If you wish to travel with more than the checked baggage allowance you can pre-purchase an Additional Baggage Allowance before you go, at lower rates than Airport Excess Baggage charges.', 7, 1);

It covers plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added.</p>\r\n<p>If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth $3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically pay around half that.</p>\r\n<p>Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities.</p>\r\n<p>Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the U.S. aerospace industry says would support his agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs.</p>\r\n<p>Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>In a statement on the Aseman deal, Boeing cited U.S. Department of Commerce data suggesting an &ldquo;aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p>TURBOPROP TALKS</p>\r\n<p>Boeing deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022, although the U.S. planemaker must first apply for licences from the U.S. Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran&rsquo;s airlines and any and all contracts with Iran&rsquo;s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval,&rdquo; it said.</p>\r\n<p>In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in Iran&rsquo;s ageing fleet following decades of sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani&rsquo;s government strives to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear pact in the run-up to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal.</p>\r\n<p>Rouhani is likely to run a campaign highlighting economic benefits of the nuclear deal, which opened Iran to foreign investment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Rouhani must do more to improve the economy.</p>\r\n<p>Negotiators from European turboprop maker ATR were meanwhile due in Tehran to wrap up a deal to sell 20 aircraft to IranAir, industry sources said. The first aircraft has been sitting on the tarmac in Toulouse, France, for weeks, waiting for the talks to be completed.</p>\r\n<p>A deal for the airframes has already been reached but there has been uncertainty over the status of a separate deal needed for the engines, to be supplied by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada.</p>\r\n<p>The company is a subsidiary of United Technologies, one of a handful of aerospace and defense groups covered by last month&rsquo;s retaliatory sanctions by Tehran against U.S. firms, though Iran has not explicitly targeted civil aircraft engines.</p>\r\n<p>Iranian officials have told Reuters finalizing the ATR deal depends on getting a contract for engine spares and long-term maintenance of the engines once the planes are delivered.</p>', 'airline,flight,Aseman airlines,tourism,destination,iran', 104, 'data/news_image/3/0-1495703117-2464933.jpg', 1, 1479503825, 1495703117, 0),

It&rsquo;s been hard, but the experiences it has given me sure beats working in an office.

Garrulous groups of friends and families are sitting, cross-legged, on raised divans lined with colourful carpets, crowding around tables groaning with food: freshly baked flatbreads, bunches of herbs, skewers of grilled lamb and chicken, whole crispy fish, and massive platters of rice studded with tart, ruby-coloured barberries.</p>\r\n<p>In the corner, a live band are playing, one musician beating on a daf, a drum which looks like large, flat tambourine, while another plucks at a setar, a long-necked, bulbous-bodied string instrument. People at a neighbouring table see us looking blankly at the menu, written in Farsi, and offer to help me and my travel companions navigate it in their impeccable English (well, better than our Farsi, anyway).</p>\r\n<p>The atmosphere is lively, and wreathed in fragrant smoke; like most teahouses in the country, shisha pipes are part of the furniture, and provide the equivalent hit of an after-dinner liqueur. We end the night stuffing our faces with sticky, honey-covered pastries, downing delicate glasses of strong, sweet tea, and smoking ourselves silly with apple, orange blossom, and blueberry flavoured tobacco. With this kind of sugar high, who needs booze, anyway?</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s my first proper night in a country which, before I arrived, I had only a hazy knowledge of. In the run up to my departure for a two-week group tour of Iran, I&rsquo;m torn between excitement and curiosity, but also a good deal of apprehension and nerves. Even if you&rsquo;re well-travelled, Iran is properly &lsquo;other&rsquo;; with a controversial, and globally worrying, nuclear programme, it&rsquo;s viewed as suspicious, closed, and secretive &ndash; or at least it has been, up until recently.</p>\r\n<p>A theocracy, it&rsquo;s currently ruled by the Supreme Leader, a powerful Muslim cleric called Ali Khamenei. He assumed the role on the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979 after spearheading a bloody revolution which overthrew the ruling royal family, and what the religious minority feared were their increasingly decadent, oil-funded, pro-western ways.</p>\r\n<p>You can kind of understand why, when you see the deposed Shah, Mohammad Pahlavi&rsquo;s, White Palace in Tehran &ndash; it&rsquo;s rammed to the rafters with expensive European paintings and furniture &ndash; or the ridiculously OTT, Liberace-like, diamond and ruby-encrusted Peacock Throne which now sits in the capital&rsquo;s National Jewellery Museum.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Funny at the time, but how much of a sense of humour did Iran actually have in the aftermath of its revolution, which was followed by a traumatic, eight-year war with Iraq?</p>\r\n<p>What kind of people would I find there? Repressed and unhappy, or stoically going about their business? As it turned out, the people were perhaps the most amazing part of the whole journey.</p>\r\n<p>Over half of the country&rsquo;s population of around 80 million are under 35, and have no experience of pre-revolutionary life, unlike their parents or grandparents. They are incredibly well-educated, articulate, and many speak English.</p>\r\n<p>My guide, Mohammad, is no exception; a laid-back 33 year old, he is endlessly knowledgeable, and, over the fortnight, gives our group a comprehensive &ndash; and well-balanced &ndash; overview of Iran&rsquo;s often complex religious and political history. During a drive through Tehran, for example, he points out the old American embassy, which was shut down in 1979 and covered in anti-US graffiti, including a picture of the Statue of Liberty with a skull for a face. &ldquo;Most people do not think like that now,&rdquo; he explains &ndash; which reassures the two Americans in our party no end.</p>\r\n<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t take long to see that people here are fascinated by visitors, wherever they&rsquo;re from, and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. It&rsquo;s not often that I&rsquo;ve been moved to tears while wandering around a market (although the sight of the freshly decapitated goat heads for sale may have contributed to my emotional state), but at the buzzing bazaar in the small, elegant desert city of Yazd, our group was so mobbed by curious, delighted citizens eager to ask us for our impressions of Iran, welcome us to the country, and thank us for being there, that it felt a bit like being hailed as some kind of saint.</p>\r\n<p>In a way, we might be; through various conversations with people, I get the sense they hope that the more tourists come and visit, the greater the chance that some of the rules might eventually be relaxed. Though, contrary to what the media might insinuate, the country is more progressive than you would think.</p>\r\n<p>Women are fully entitled to education &ndash; I observe a few mixed groups of students celebrating their graduation on the steps of the tomb of the 14th-century poet Hafez, in the vibrant university city of Shiraz, and meet several who have jobs as biologists, engineers and lawyers &ndash; and they are very conscious about how they look.</p>\r\n<p>This goes beyond fashion, though I absolutely loved the way women, particularly in the larger cities, push the boundaries of hijab to the limit. Colourful silk scarves are worn right at the back of the head, designer sunglasses propped up on top, teamed with slim, cigarette-style trousers and elegant belted jackets.</p>\r\n<p>The ultimate accessory is a strip of bandage across the bridge of the nose: this signals its wearer has had rhinoplasty, the most popular cosmetic surgery in Iran, which itself has the highest rate of rhinoplasty in the world.</p>\r\n<p>As one woman sweetly explained, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t show our beauty through our hair or clothes, so we do it through our face.&rdquo; I confess I am surprised; the women here are beautiful as they are, but it&rsquo;s a small rebellion, and a way of trying to be more western. Despite not having access to Facebook or Twitter, people do have Instagram, and while TV is largely state controlled, you can watch international films and shows.</p>\r\n<p>But while Iran&rsquo;s status as a modern, potential power-player on the international stage is hopefully underway, thanks to the lifting of economic sanctions in January 2016, and due to its vast oil reserves and relative political stability (compared to most of the Middle East), it&rsquo;s the country&rsquo;s past that most visitors will be keen to explore.</p>\r\n<p>Iran is overflowing with history. It has 19 Unesco heritage sites, many of which are centuries old and hark back to the origins of the Persian Empire, which was established by Cyrus the Great in 550BC. The most famous of these is Persepolis; around 560 miles south of Tehran, it&rsquo;s a sprawling, ancient city complex which was largely built by Cyrus&rsquo; successor, Darius I. An impressive, large-scale citadel, with a huge entrance gate, a central palace, vast terraces, elaborate columns, and more, unfortunately most of it was burned down in 330BC by Alexander the Great &ndash; as revenge for the burning of a Greek temple in Athens by Persian king, Xerxes. Whoops. Thankfully, plenty remains, which was successfully excavated in the 1930s.</p>\r\n<p class=\"pull-quote active\">IRAN HAS 19 UNESCO HERITAGE SITES, MANY OF WHICH HARK BACK TO THE PERSIAN EMPIRE</p>\r\n<p>Arriving on a hot, dusty morning, having travelled along sandy desert roads lined with pistachio trees, we&rsquo;re faced with hordes of tourists keen to use their selfie sticks. We pass through the imposing Gate of All Nations, its huge columns carved with creatures with the bodies of winged bulls and the heads of bearded men.</p>\r\n<p>Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of Persia, where Darius would receive his important visitors; Mohammad points out incredible carved bas-reliefs depicting Darius receiving gifts from foreign leaders. Although I&rsquo;m nearly left behind, thanks to a friendly group of Iranian schoolgirls who want me to describe life in London when I should be boarding the coach, I make it to the nearby site of Naqsh-e Rustam, where Darius and three of his ancestors are buried in awe-inspiring giant tombs, cut high into rock.</p>\r\n<p>Some history is more unusual; on the outskirts of Yazd, the first town we head to after Tehran, are the Game of Thrones-sounding Towers of Silence. These are two wide, flat, circular structures each built on a hill in the 17th century by the followers of the Zoroastrian religion.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>By Laura Millar</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gadventures.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gadventures.co.uk</a></p>', 'iran,tourism,destination,travel', 36, 'data/news_image/14/0-1495701358-Amir_Chakhmaq_Complex_Hadi_Karimi.jpg', 1, 1480291927, 1495701358, 0);

There are two types of tourist visa for Iran:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1- Standard Tourist Visa : This visa is issued ahead of your travel date and you received it at one of Iran&rsquo;s embassies, consulates or mailed to you before your planned departure to Iran. Good for those who like to plan ahead and make sure everything is in order before boarding the airplane.</p>\r\n<p>2- Iran Visa On Arrival (VOA) or Iran airport visa: You apply and get this visa up on arrival. The scope and purpose of the visa is to give a number of nationalities to get their visa at the main entrance gateways of Iran like Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz Kish and Mashahd airport and more recently at a couple southern ports of Iran at the Persian gulf.<br /> There are pros and cons to either of these visa categories. The Visa on arrival is a relatively new thing and works great most of the time but not always. It is perhaps a great option if you like to take the chance and get your visa up on arrival. The Visa on arrival is cheaper because you don&rsquo;t pay us that $60 for the processing fee but you are still going to have to pay for consular fees when you are receiving your visa.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a fee schedule for your reference:</p>\r\n<p>Note: Visa on arrival fees that you need to pay in cash at the airport to get your visa. Add to that some 20 Euro for the Travel insurance fees. These fees are subject to change at around March of each year .</p>', 1, '', 1),

This visa is issued for a maximum stay of 30 days with a possibility of extension in Iran. The visa is valid for a period of 3 months from the date of issue. Depending on your nationality and the consulate you depend on, you can submit your documents to obtain a visa in a few days with authorization code or letter of invitation (see below). Most consulates require an authorization number from the Foreign Ministry in Tehran. Without this authorization number, it is not possible to guarantee that the visa will be granted. Obtaining this approval is the most important step in the visa application, after which there will be not much left to do. You will have your visa in two weeks (or even 1 or 2 days in case of emergency visa). Persevoyages as an <strong>Iranian travel agency in Paris</strong> offers the obtaining of <strong>letter of invitation for Iran visa</strong> service as well as visa collecting service.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>1. Get the invitation letter (authorization code or authorization number)</h3>\r\n<p>After receiving your application form (button below) and your scanned passport, the official request will be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will be subject to a formal procedure. At the end of the procedure a letter of authorization will be issued and then faxed to the Iranian consulate that you have indicated in the form. We will give you the reference code of this letter that allows you to apply for your visa. This code is only valid for the consulate mentioned and only for 1 month from the date of issue (though there is the possibility of an extension but not exceeding 3 months).</p>\r\n<h3>2. Collecting the visa from the consulate</h3>\r\n<p>When you have the reference code, you will need to refer to the consulate with your passport (original) <sup>(1)</sup>, travel insurance <sup>(2)</sup>, the completed visa application form <sup>(3)</sup> (obtainable from the consulate or downloadable from their <a href=\\\"http://amb-iran.fr/fr/consulat/visa/demande_visa.pdf\\\" target=\\\"blank\\\">website </a>or <a href=\\\"http://www.persevoyages.fr/sites/default/files/demande_visa.pdf\\\" target=\\\"blank\\\">here </a>), 2 passport sized photos (3 * 4, white background, with hair covered for ladies for some consulates), visa fees and authorization number (always check the required documents with the consulate, since there may be different rules in different consulates). You can also send documents and receive the visa by mail (<a href=\\\"http://amb-iran.fr/fr/consulat/visa.htm#Visa_de_tourisme\\\" target=\\\"blank\\\">Tourist Visa</a>). Please contact the consulate for details.<br />Normally, the time for obtaining a visa is about 2 weeks (it can still be obtained within 48 hours in case of emergency or even within 24 hours if you insist, and if you provide proof). The fee is &euro; 75 (for the urgent visa) and 50 &euro; (for normal visa). You can pay by credit card at the Iranian Embassy.<br />From the moment you got your visa, you have 3 months to go to Iran, then your visa will be valid for the period you have chosen, the date of your arrival in Iran will be the first day of your visa .</p>\r\n<p class=\\\"strong\\\">As of now, it is mandatory for the applicants to have their fingerprint taken at the embassy. The applicants have therefore to attend in person to register their fingerprints.</p>\r\n<hr class=\\\"dashed-line\\\" />(<strong class=\\\"strong\\\">1</strong>) Your passport must be valid for the next 6 months by the time you apply for the visa.<br />\r\n<p>(<strong class=\\\"strong\\\">2</strong>) As for the insurance, if you have a Visa credit card, ask for a certificate from your bank manager. Generally, travel insurance is included in the contract.</p>\r\n(<strong class=\\\"strong\\\">3</strong>) Preferably, the application form must be completed on the computer. Consulate may refuse to accept handwritten application forms.<br /><br />\r\n<p>For more information about sending your documents, we invite you to <a href=\\\"http://www.amb-iran.fr/fr/contact.htm\\\" target=\\\"blank\\\">Contact </a>the Iranian Embassy in Paris.</p>\r\n<p>Please complete the form below for each passenger and send us the scanned passports for all travelers to info@globaltourismpro.com.

Even today, the city retains much of its past glory. This hub of creativity was rightly granted the title &ldquo;Half-of-the-World&rdquo; due to its flourishing commerce and a great variety of astonishing arts ranging from poetry and handicrafts to unique architectural styles. We begin our journey through Isfahan by visiting <strong>Chehel-Sotun Palace</strong>. This architectural masterpiece is a pavilion in the midst of a park at the far end of a long pool which is a typical design of all Persian Gardens. The palace has been constructed for the King&rsquo;s entertainment and receptions during Safavid-era. Chehel Sotun Palace literally means &ldquo;Forty Columns&rdquo; which was inspired by the twenty slender wooden columns supporting the entrance pavilion, which, when reflected in the water of the fountain, are said to appear to be forty. The most startling feature of the pavilion is the brilliant interior design and paintings which includes fabulous roofs, old tile-covered floors, and painted walls featuring scenes of battles and celebrations hold by the king. Chehel-Sotun Palace is not just an old building; it tells us about history and each and every crack on the walls or the floors holds a story of the past.

All parts of the mosque have been woven together in great harmony to present a seamless, matchless whole. Religious concepts along with traditional symbols are all fully tangible in the design of the structure. The dome of the mosque standing on top with tall Minarets soaring into the sky, seem to invite every passerby in to worship and pray the Lord. <strong>Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque</strong>, standing on the eastern side of Naghsh-e-Jahan Square, is considered as one of the marvels of Persian architecture.

There is an underground corridor offering a passage from the building to Ali-Qapu palace which is going to be the next piece of history to visit. <strong>The Pavilion of Ali-Qapu</strong> is a grand palace located on the western side of the Naghsh-e-Jahan Square, opposite of Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque. The building was named Ali-Qapu which means &ldquo;great gate&rdquo; in as much as it was right at the entrance to the Safavid palaces which stretched from the Naghsh-e-Jahan Square to the Chahar Bagh Boulevard. The structures was a symbol of the government&rsquo;s power and was originally used as a place to hold important political negotiations. Ali-Qapu is rich in naturalistic wall paintings; they abound with floral, animal and bird motifs.
